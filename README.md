Data Engineering YouTube Analysis Project :

Overview :
        The Data Engineering YouTube Analysis Project is designed to securely manage, streamline, and analyze both structured and semi-structured YouTube video data. Focusing on video categories and trending metrics, this project aims to derive meaningful insights that can inform content strategies and performance optimization.

Project Goals:

    Data Ingestion :
        Develop a robust mechanism to ingest data from various sources efficiently.
    ETL System:
        Transform raw data into a structured and usable format through a comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.
    Data Lake :
        Establish a centralized repository to store data from multiple sources, ensuring easy access and management.
    Scalability:
        Design the system to seamlessly scale as data volume increases, maintaining performance and reliability.
    Cloud Integration :
        Utilize cloud services, specifically AWS, to handle large-scale data processing beyond local computing capabilities.    
    Reporting :
        Create interactive dashboards to visualize data and answer key analytical questions.

Technologies and Services :
    Amazon Web Services (AWS) :
        Amazon S3
        Object storage service providing high scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
    AWS IAM :
        Identity and Access Management service for secure access control to AWS resources.
    Amazon QuickSight :
        Scalable, serverless business intelligence (BI) service with machine learning capabilities for insightful data visualization.
    AWS Glue :
        Serverless data integration service facilitating data discovery, preparation, and combination for analytics and machine learning.
    AWS Lambda :
        Serverless computing service that enables code execution without the need for server management.
    AWS Athena :
        Interactive query service allowing direct querying of data stored in Amazon S3 without the need for data loading.



Dataset :
    The project utilizes a comprehensive Kaggle dataset containing daily statistics of popular YouTube videos across various regions. Keyfeatures of the dataset include:

        Video Metadata :
                Video title, channel title, publication time, tags, description.
        Engagement Metrics :
                Views, likes, dislikes, comment count.
        Categorization :
                category_id field, which varies by region and is linked to a JSON file detailing category information.
The dataset encompasses up to 200 trending videos published daily for multiple locations, providing a rich source for trend analysis and category-based insights.
